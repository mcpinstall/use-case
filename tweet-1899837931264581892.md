You can now connect your MCP host to Weaviateâ€™s vector search capabilities!

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduced by 
@AnthropicAI
 is a proposal to standardize AI interfaces.

AI models need context from external knowledge sources to produce accurate responses.

But with a growing pool of context sources, the interfaces can get messy and complex quickly.

The MCP aims to solve this by creating a consistent method for providing context to AI models.

You can now integrate Weaviateâ€™s vector search capabilities through a Weaviate MCP server for Claude Desktop.
